# Stero-Vision
In this project, we are going to implement the concept of Stereo Vision with 3 different datasets, each of them contains 2 images of the same scenario but taken from two different camera angles. By comparing the information about a scene from 2 vantage points, we can obtain the 3D information by examining the relative positions of objects.
